# Indigo (fix)
Fix for Gowixx's "Indigo SB" (which is really just a massmention he released bcuz it doesn't work with our compiler/obfuscation, but it's pretty cool still)

Also go buy Okuru (our fully featured selfbot) at https://okuru.xyz and join the discord (NOT FOR TESTING INDIGO IN)

Im not forking Gowixx's repo for this cuz theres a bunch of code in here that he'll hate lol

## How do install
Replace the token in config.json with yours then CD into the directory and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
python main.py
```

## Issues
If you need any help join the Okuru discord, but some common issues are:
- You haven't installed python lol
- You haven't got python added to path
- You haven't got pip installed (Re-run python installer and do custom installation)

- "Connection Dropped. Retrying in 10 seconds."
